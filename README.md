## Basic Description (minimal spoilers)  
  
Meet the Archeologist, also known as the Pilgrim, the Adventurer (adventures not included), or the Tomb Raider: a crafty and hyperactive Slugcat that stumbled upon a karmic blessing... or a curse. Set up on a journey to Your favourite Iterators who will finally properly recognize You - and on the way, learn the importance of nutritious breakfest.  
  
A composition of mods combining the Survivor/Hunter experience (and inspired by the many other Slugcats out there). Minor mods usable separately.  
  
### Main Features  
- **Karma/Food/Stats scaling:** High Karma is difficult to sustain, but the energy leads to great power. No matter the Karma however, hungry Slugcat is extra weak. (Higher Karma also provides some utility and removes ability prices (see below))
- **Playable on all difficulties.** (Monk gets more energy from fruits to allow him sustain high Karmas as well; I recommend [HunterSpawns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlO82XQMyXaY79xhIF2rRuiWxUYStPFu/view) mod for the Survivor)  
- **Spear proficiency:** Spear-on-back is a must have for the Archeologist, and so is the ability to pull out spears stuck in walls, allowing him to get out of many tough spots: for a price. (Both mods optional, or usable separately)  
- **Extra inventory:** When you're swimming in ancient artifacts, you gotta learn how to handle them more efficiently. Forget one place to store you pearls - now you got two! (Optional/usable-separately; size is configurable and potentially "unlimited")  
- **Upgraded CraftingMod:** I took the liberty of building upon Pirate-Robs crafting. Featuring crafting time, prices, and new recipes, including reverse engineering. Ever wanted to eat the glowing insides of a lantern, or just break your spear in half out of sheer frustration? Now you can! (requires KarmaAppetite_Base module to function; [you may also want to try the independent original](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ncw1LacgQ2BIFJdovaphjtJKiaqBlaBs/view))  
- **Love for the Moon:** Did you know that when Moon likes Slugcat too much, she starts acting indifferent/neutral? Turns out one of her neurons was faulty, and she feels much better since it was replaced. Also fixing the good old betrayal bug. (usable separately)
